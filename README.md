# Java Loops

This repository is part of coursework for the Full Stack Web Development course from [Factoria F5](https://factoriaf5.org).

## Instructions
Create a program that, given an integer n, prints its multiplication table (from 1 to 10). (Terminal output is not necessary)

Each multiple n * i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result (multiplication table).

Example: given n = 5

### Output:
``` 
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

## Requirement:
A test must be provided. At least one test of the method that returns the array is required.
